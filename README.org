** Launch
To run this project, type the following command inside the *~/Project/src* directory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

Django version 4.0.5, using settings 'class_manager.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
#+END_SRC

That means that you’ve started the Django server, a lightweight web server written purely in Python.
Now that the server’s running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ with your web browser.


** Sources
This app is made for a college project that we had to create a web API.
We used the documentation of [[https://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]] and some tutorials from web.
